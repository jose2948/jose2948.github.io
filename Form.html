			<h3>Running Gait</h3>
			<p>When it comes to running, the running form is always undervalued but yet the most important value, it dictates the tempo of someone's speed, how long that person will last running, and to keep yourself away from getting injured. “Take a look at your running form and make any necessary adjustments and improvements. … will help reduce chance of injury, increase speed, and boost efficiency. Your running gait plays a vital role in the many health benefits of running. It enables you to run longer distances at a greater intensity with less pain and discomfort” (Cronkleton). The running form is the way a person runs, based on the way someone runs, it could influence their speed. If someone has a bad form it could lead to bad posture. Running gait is the cycle where one leg swings backward while the other goes forward for the next step. The same thing happens with the arms each time the leg goes forward, the hand on the other side goes forward as well. </p>

			<h2>Staying away from injuries</h2>
			<p>“To prevent injuries to your lower body, use a midfoot strike, and avoid hitting the ground with your heel. This allows your foot to land directly under your hip as you drive your body forward” (Conkleton). The heel of the foot is never used when running, jogging, or sprinting. If the heel is used by a runner it could cause knee pains which result in knee injuries. When someone is jogging the speed of that person is very slow so the best option is to use the midfoot strike(the middle part of the foot) to make contact on the ground. But when sprinting, the forefoot strike(consisting of the phalanges, metatarsal and sesamoid bones) is the correct way to run with. A foot should touch the ground right under where the hip would be, then with that leg the runner pushes his body from the ground forward and repeats with the other leg while using the midfoot strike while jogging.</p>

			<h2>Good Posture</h2>
			<p> “Coordinating your breathing to line up at the same pace as the speed of your feet helps keep a good posture and less muscle tension as well as being able to use more energy and conserve it” (Cronkleton). For example, each time a runner pushes his left leg backwards he should breathe in and after using that leg again he should breathe out, he should maintain a rhythm with his breathing and the pace at which he is running. When jogging a runner should be taking deep breaths without exaggerating. If not, the person will feel tired and be gasping for air much faster than before his body starts aching of tiredness. This isn’t the cause for everyone, other people can keep their own breathing under control at their own pace. The right running form has really helped people stay away from injuries and have a better form, this has been a technological advancement for runners or any athletes.
