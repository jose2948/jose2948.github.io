			<h3>Introduction</h3>
			<p>“The global average time for a marathon stands right around four hours and twenty-one minutes” (Asics). For women, 43 percent of those who run a marathon do it in less than four hours and 5 minutes. 64 percent of men who run marathons finish a marathon in that same exact time. Did you know that the world's fastest marathon race record in an eligible course is 2:01:09 which is held by Eliud Kipchoge? His pace per mile during this race was 4 minutes and 37 seconds.</p>

				When it comes to running people do not pay much attention to the right form for running, they believe if they just keep attempting to run faster, they will push past their limits and be able to run faster or for longer periods of time. But that's not precisely the way it works and real runners, or at least people who understand how to properly run, just as Eliud Kipchoge know that there is a lot more to learn so we people could run for longer periods of time or sprint faster. But in order to be a better runner or sprinter a person must train the right muscles throughout the whole body to become stronger (explosive when running). Every runner should have the appropriate clothing and shoes for running or sprinting. Knowing the proper form of running could even help everybody. Also Tech related devices have helped runners improve with speed and to stay away from injuries. A lot of technological advancements have been made from new shoes to help run in any ground landscape, to gadgets helping with injuries and performances, even dynamic workouts have been shown to be better than regular or static workouts in the past century. </p>
